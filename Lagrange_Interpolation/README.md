# Lagrange interpolation coding sample files
`Lagrange_coef` obtains coefficients for Lagrange polynomial.
`Lagrange_eval` uses coefficients from `Lagrange_coef` to evaluate Lagrange interpolation polynomial at a specific point.
`Lagrange_interpolation` plots Lagrange coefficients against evaluated interpolation values at each timepoint.
